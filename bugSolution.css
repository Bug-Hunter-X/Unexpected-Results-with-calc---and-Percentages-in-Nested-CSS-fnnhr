One approach to solve the problem is to use explicit widths for parent elements:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Explicit width */
}

.child {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```

Now, `50%` is calculated relative to the `500px` width of the parent, resulting in predictable behaviour. 

Another approach is to avoid percentage-based calculations altogether within `calc()` in contexts where parent widths are dynamic:

```css
.parent {
  width: 50%;
}

.child {
  width: 270px; /* Fixed width instead of calculation */
}
```

Choosing the right approach depends on the specific context of the layout.
