# Unexpected Results with calc() and Percentages in Nested CSS

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue with using the `calc()` function in CSS alongside percentages, particularly when dealing with nested elements.  The `calc()` function doesn't always behave as intuitively expected, potentially leading to layout problems.

## The Problem

The issue stems from the context in which `calc()` percentages are evaluated.  The percentage is relative to the containing element's computed width. If the parent element's width itself is dynamic or undefined, unexpected results can occur.

## Solution

The solution often involves ensuring that all parent elements have explicitly defined widths or using alternative layout techniques to avoid ambiguity.  Using fixed units (like pixels) for the additive part of the calculation is safer.  Alternatively, using flexbox or grid can simplify layout and circumvent some of the issues associated with `calc()` and percentages.
